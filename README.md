I've created a Data Analysis on Transactione executed in Phonepe using PowerBI.This analysis focuses on understanding the transaction patterns on PhonePe based on three key features: type of payment, type of user, and various banks.

# Type of Payment: Transactions are categorized based on payment types, such as UPI, wallet, credit/debit cards, and bank transfers. This helps in identifying the most popular payment methods and trends over time.

# Type of User: Users are segmented into different categories, such as individual users, merchants, and enterprises. Analyzing these segments can reveal user behavior, preferences, and the impact of different user types on transaction volumes.

# Various Banks: The analysis includes transactions across different banks, examining factors like transaction success rates, processing times, and bank-specific preferences. This helps in understanding the performance of different banks on the platform and identifying any potential issues.

Overall, this analysis provides insights into user behavior, payment preferences, and bank performance, enabling better decision-making and optimization of services on the PhonePe platform.
